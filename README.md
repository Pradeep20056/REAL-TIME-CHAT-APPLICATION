I have developed a real-time chat web application using React and JSX for the frontend, along with a WebSocket server for the backend to enable instant message communication. This project demonstrates my ability to build interactive, dynamic web applications with real-time functionality. On the frontend, I utilized React.js for building component-based UI, Tailwind CSS for responsive and modern styling, and Framer Motion to enhance user experience with smooth entrance and transition animations. The application features a clean and visually appealing layout, including animated headers, chat bubbles, and a responsive input field and send button.

For real-time communication, I implemented WebSockets, enabling bidirectional, low-latency message transfer between the client and server. The chat interface updates instantly as messages are received, providing a seamless experience without requiring page reloads. Messages are timestamped and displayed with smooth fade and slide-in effects using Framer Motion, giving a polished and modern look.

The backend runs on Node.js with a WebSocket server listening for incoming connections and broadcasting messages to all connected clients. This setup ensures that messages are transmitted in real-time to everyone in the chat session.

The overall app architecture is clean and maintainable, using useState and useEffect hooks for state management and side effects. Going forward, I plan to enhance this project by adding features like user authentication, message history storage using databases like MongoDB, private chat rooms, and deployment to platforms like Vercel or Render. This project highlights my growing skills in full-stack development and real-time web technologies.
